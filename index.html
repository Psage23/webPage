            <article>"In the US there are 574 Federally recognized tribes and 245 recognized Native languages.
                The problem is that the number of Native Languages that are becoming extinct, so far 65 have became extinct and 75 are near extinction.<br>
                <br>Why is losing a Native language even an issue? <br>
                <br>The reason is, for the Native community their language connects them with their culture and sense of identity."

            <article>"More than one-third of the world's languages have fewer than 1,000 speakers. Predictions say between 50%-90% of endangered languages will disappear by the next century. <br>

                <br>How can it help preserve our past, while also bringing us into the future? Good question! <br>
                
                <br>Technology help preserve transcripts from the remaining elders & even connect Natives that live away from their reservations resources to learn their language."

            <article>"AI technology has many benefits, and the table shows some uses for this technology.
                The main focus, however, is on the Speech Recognition simply because it has the most influence on restoration of Native languages."
